## What is Programming language
● It is language which helps to communicate with computers{they are not able to understand human languages}
● We humans have lots oflanguages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)
● Computers have many languages too
 ○ Assembly,C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go….
● Prog lang. Helps us to write programs using those languages
## What is Program?
● A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming
language.
● An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform toaccomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician,Al-Khwarizmi.
● Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a finitenumber of steps.
● With those steps Programs Do a Specific task Correctly.Algorithm Example
● To ask someone, his/her name, you will do the following step:
  a. You Walk to the person
  b. Greetings
  c. Wait for answer back
 d. “What is your name?”
● There will be a lot of kinds of algorithms to do a specific task Evolution of I/O { Input / Output }
● Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on punch cards with all the data they required and executed together with other programs that used the same libraries. Outputwas to aline printer.
● Later developments introduced interactive processing which allowed the user to provide data while the program was running.This normally takes place in a Question & Answer format.
## Generation of Computers
1. First Generation: Vacuum Tubes => punch cards
2. Second Generation: Transistors => Programming started here with Assembly
3. Third Generation: Integrated Circuits => BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl and Ada
4. Fourth Generation: Microprocessors => Python, SQL,Matlab
5. Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence
They could only solve one problemat a time. It would take days or even
weeks to set up a new Program on

## Types of Programming Languages
● Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humansdon’t understand this
● SO bas ed on the closeness of the language tohumans we classify it into 3
● The more they become low to the machine theyare faster.
● The more they become like human language theyare slower.
### A) LOW level programming language
● These languages are more like machines but with lotsof effort people can
understand them. Theyare close to the hardwareof the computer.
● Ex: Assembly
### B) High level Programming languages
● They are more close tohuman languages.
● Example:Python,C++,Java,JS…
### C) Medium Level
● Languages Between Lowlevel and High level, they combine both
● Ex: C-lang
#### How do high level languages work?
As we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binarys, and if we code
with high level languages how do computers understand us?
1) Compilers: are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then computer will execute it
        Example: C,C++,Java,..
3) Interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by line
a) Example: python Uses of Programming language
● Android Application Development
● Website Development
● Machine learning
● Artificial Intelligence
● Game Development
● Big data Technology
● Desktop software development
● Hacking tool dev
### What is Python Programming?
● Python is a High level & interpreted programming language. => Very easy to learn
● It is Very SImplified language any one can write with it, also can read it.
## History of python
● Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.
● Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.
● Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing it's progress.
### Uses of Python
● Data visualization
● Data analysis
● Machine learning
● Artificial intelligence
● Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
● Game development
● Hacking Script writing Variables
● Variables are a value holders /containers/
● They store data
● We give some value to some word.
● example : number = 10 => from now on my python program knows the value of
number is 10.
● The process of giving value to word is called Variable Declaration
● The word that holds the data is called Identifier
● We can Print value of variables by giving the identifier
Data types
● Have you seen the data types we used on the variable slide?
● There are a lot of Data types on python
## A) Numeric Data type
● int(integer) - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
● float - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to 15 decimal places.
● complex - holds complex numbers.
★ You can Identify The type of a variable with the keyword ‘type()’
## B) String Data
● String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For
example, var = “ ” or var = ‘ ’
## C) Sequence Data
A) Lists
a) List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by
commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]. For example, languages =
["Swift", "Java", "Python"]
b) To access items from a list, we use the index number (0, 1, 2 ...). For
example, languages[0]

### 2) Tuple
● Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.
● we use the parentheses () to store items of a tuple. For example, product = ('Xbox', 499.99)
● Similar to lists, we use the index number to access tuple items in Python
D) Dictionary data
● Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value
pairs.
○ user1 = {'username':’nathan26,’password’:’p@$$word’}
■ username and password = key
■ nathan26 & p@$$word = value
● We use keys to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around. For example,
