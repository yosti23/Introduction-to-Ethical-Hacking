# Linux File Hierarchy
● Linux/UNIX have a special file system than windows.
● File system is a directory structure that the OS uses. 

## System Files
● System Files are files used by the system software( OS ).
● Windows: System files appear under the local disk C:
● Linux: System files appear under the root directory ( / )
## File structure in detail
1) / ( root )
    ○ Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
    ○ The only root user has the right to write under thisdirectory
2) bin - Binary executables
○ Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode; for all users
i) e.g)  cat, ls , cp , pwd
3) /boot - Boot loader files
  ○ Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
  ○ Example:
    initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic,
    vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic
4) /dev - Essential Device files
   ○ These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
   ○ Example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0
5) /etc - et cetera
   ○ Contains configuration files  required by all programs.
   ○ This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
   ○ Example: /etc/resolv.conf,/etc/logrotate.conf
6) /home - Home directory
   ○ Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
   ○ example: /home/nathan,/home/rexder
7) /lib - Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin & /sbin
   ○ Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
    ○ Example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7
8) /media - Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs
     ○ Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
     ○ Examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cd recorder for CD writer
9) /mnt - Temporarily mounted file
    ○ Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount
    filesystems.
10) /opt - Optional application software packages
  ○ Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
  ○ Add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.
11) /sbin - Essential system binaries
○ Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
○ The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.
12) /tmp - Temporary Files
 ○ Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
 ○ Files under this directory are deleted when system is
 rebooted.
### Text Editors
● Programs That used for text processing.
● Linux command line text editors
    ○ VIM
    ○ Nano
    ○ Emacs
    ○ Neovim
● Linux Graphical Text editors
    ○ Sublime
    ○ Vscode
    ○ Gedit

## Opening vim
 Syntax
    vim yourfilename
#### Vim is by default on command mode when you open it.
To get on insert mode you have to type ‘i’
● Inside Command mode you can
    ○ Save
    ○ Save & quit
    ○ Force Quit & Save

    ○ Execute bash commands
### Linux User Management
● On Computer system, person who uses the computer is called “user”
● Every Users have Group.
● Users have their own file & applications.
● To know our name on linux -> “ whoami “
● Those users have power/privilege.
● On linux there's 2 kinds users.
   ○ Root id = 0
   ○ Normal User id start with 1-999
The root user have the power to do everything on linux , but if users want to have a root access they add sudo in front of the command .
### sudo YourCommand
● SUDO = Superuser do , used to pass permission denied
● On linux, to create users you can use the following commands
  ○ Useradd -> simple
  ○ Adduser -> Detailed
● Useradd command
  ○ sudo useradd username
● Adduser command
  ○ sudo adduser username
The User files are stored inside /etc/passwd
The User password are stored inside /etc/shadow
When you create a user it creates a group with that name.
