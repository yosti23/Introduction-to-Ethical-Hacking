## Script installation
● Some hacking tools are developed by some peoples and those peoples make it open-source, that means we can get those scripts/programs from github.
● So we can download and use it. For this purpose git have a feature called ‘clone’
● Syntax
  ○ git clone <link_of_the_script_from_github> Script modules
● Scripts are made with scripting languages(programming) like { python,bash,go,ruby,...}
● So when we use these programming languages to do tasks their is something called modules/libraries these are needed to run the script as the dependencies.
● More commands
  ○ ps -> for process running on my shell
  ○ ps -A -> view all running process
  ○ ps -u username -> view users process
● PID - Process ID To stop process
  ○ Kill [options] [PID]
● More on kill
  ○ kill -19 PID -> to stop the process
  ○ kill -18 PID -> to resume the process we stopped
  ○ kill -9 PID -> to Stop a process immediately
   ○ … there are 31 options
